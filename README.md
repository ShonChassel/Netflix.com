## My Process

I developed this project over the course of approximately A month and a half. In order to learn as much as I can from the development of this project, I implemented certain features from scratch including accessible and scrollable tabs, a carousel functionality, and infinite loading.

### Tools

- NextJS. 
- typescript.
- Stripe API for payments
- tailwind for (CSS grid & CSS Flexbox & Media queries)
- Firebase authentication services & Firestore database

In order to search and obtain information about TV shows, I used the TMDB API and the OMDB API.
